# Sudoku

Systematic algorithms from the previous task are not always easy to program, but everyone can handle local search/optimization. We pay for it with the incompleteness of local algorithms, but their simplicity balances it.

Formulate the SUDOKU as local search task, i.e. in the sense of the hill climb algorithm.
Try different variants of how to change the solution candidate locally and compare them.
A 9x9 field is a piece of cake for today's computers (of course, as ever), so try generalized SUDOKU on a larger playing area.
