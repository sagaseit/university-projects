# Systematic search

Implement five methods of systematic searching of the state space and demonstrates the functionality of the implemented algorithms in solving the task of finding a path in the maze. The programming language in which the algorithms will be implemented is chosen by the student.
Solve the task of finding a path in the maze using five methods of systematic search of the status space:
Random Search (Random Search),
In-depth scan (DFS) without depth limitation (recursive or stack-iterative),
Landscape search (BFS),
Hungry Search (hungry Search),
A * algorithm
be and with such heuristics to always find the shortest path.
or b with other heuristics - the student must be able to explain the behavior of the algorithm
Input: maze for testing algorithms. Mazes are available in the form of text files.
Output: a simple visualization of the activity of each of the algorithms + a list of the length of the path found + information which fields the program counts in the length of the path
